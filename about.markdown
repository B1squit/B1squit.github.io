Welcome to my blog! I am mainly interested in topics close to hardware, but also do a bit of experimenting in other areas such as this blog and analogue design, in particular amateur radio. The main objective of this blog is to document these experiences so that they do not get forgotten on some drive and to also develop some experience with webdev.
